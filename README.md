# CurseGraph

This small application creates a background process in SystemTray (On Windows, its the small icon bar on bottom right) and tracks and records your mods total downloads every 15 minutes. By default, my mods are added, but you can press "Remove" to remove them and "Add a Mod" in main menu to add a new mod. Valid ModID is "224778-latcoremc" (the ending of your Curse project's link). Files are saved in C:/Users/username/LatMod/CurseGraph/, formatted in Json
